        <h2>About Civilization 250</h2>
        <section class = "paragraph">
            <p>
                The Civilization 250 is a strategy game that immerses players in the roles of historical
                leaders. Each player takes turns, making decisions like move their people, build cities,
                or improve their territories, all with the ultimate goal of guiding their civilization to
                glorious victory.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Civilization 250, the term “unit” encompasses any entity capable of movement on
                the game map. There are four distinct types of units in the game: settlers, workers,
                warriors, and archers. The military units, such as warrior and archer units, possess
                the capability to engage in combat with other units. On the contrary, non-military
                units, specifically settlers and workers, have different capabilities. The settlers can
                establish new cities, while the workers are tasked with enhancing the terrain.
            </p>
            <p>
                A significant portion of the game revolves around unit movement within the game world.
                The world is depicted as a two-dimensional grid, and each individual cell within the
                grid is referred to as a “tile”. You will march your military units to engage in conflicts
                with neighboring civilizations or guide your non-military units to discover new lands
                and cultivate new territory.
